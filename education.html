I studied there from standard 1 until standard 6. The school is located only a few minutes from my house, but my mom will always send me and fetch me by car. During standard 3, i was sent to my neighbour house because my mom was working as a kindergarden teacher and she was worried of my staying at home alone.
		my mom will always sent me to our neighbour house early in the morning and later in the noon she will picked me up and send to school. When I was in primary school, I used to be a librarian and usually will stay late at school for my library duty. Our school library was not big and the library collection were not that many but yet I still enjoy my time being a librarian
		at my primary school. Below is my primary school logo.</p><br><br>
