		<br><p style="font-size: 16px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;">During the pandemic of Covid-19, I have try a lot of new hobbies to occupy free times. The first new hobby I tried is sculpturing. Even before 
				the pandemic, I have been wanting to try to sculpture because I am a big fan of fine art. When I first try sculpturing, I was having a hard time in shaping the clay to my desired design but after a while I've got you used to it. 
				Sculpturing require a lot of times and technique but it is fun hobby. My first sculpture is a abstract vase that was now become one of the house intreior decoration. It took me 4 hours to shaped the vase and also smoothening the vase 
				surface. After 4 hours of shaping and smoothening, I let the sculture dry for a week to make sure that it is hard enough. But during a week of it's drying, I would smoothening the vase surface everyday using a damp sponge. After a week, 
				I varnished the vase to make it glossy and let it dry again for 3 days. Now, the vase has been used as one of our house interior decoration. Even though it is tiring and require a lot of times, but I really like this hobby because it make 
				me relax. After sculpturing my first art, i then continue making vases, trinket dish, mug and also a hand scultpture.</p><br><br>

		<br><p style="font-size: 16px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;">My second new hobby is baking. This hobby is actually my old hobby but ever since I have furthering my studies, I ended up stop baking. But during the 
				pandemic, I started back to my old hobby and try numerous amount of viral recipe from Youtube and Tik Tok. As we all know, during the pandemic, most people have tried all the viral recipes they found on the internet and making sure that they 
				did not miss any of them. from the pandemic until now, I have tried numerous amount of recipe I have found on the Interent such as the viral Matcha Chocolate Chip Cookie, Korean Bento Cake, Strawberry Shortcakes and many more. Most of the 
				baking recipe I got is from Youtube and Tik Tok. Some of the recipe did meet my expectation and taste really good, bout some of them did not taset that good and did not suit my tastebud but overall it is good and fun to bake all of these recipe.</p><br><br>

		<br><br><div style="text-align: center; background-color: #ffccd9;" width="110px"><b><li>Painting Experience<li></b></div>
			<br><p style="font-size: 16px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;">My last new hobby is painting. Just like I stated before, I really love fine arts so I have been making many arts. Even though I have been into art for 
					more than 6 years but I have never try to paint on any of my sketch and drawing. This is because I'm afraid that I will ruin the sketch and drawing that I have made. Because of that, I never paint my sketch and drawing even though I feel like 
					it is to plain without colors. But during the pandemic, I started to have a thought on painting my drawing. I started to search on painting videos and try to polish my painting skills. After learning and practicing, I then started to paint one of 
					my oldest drawing and to my surprised it turn out just like what I have imagine. The drawing were no longer plain and it looks so beautiful with the colours scheme I have chose. Ever since that, I would literally paint all my pieces right after i 
					finish drawing. Thank to those painting video, I am no longer afraid to paint my pieces and give me a lot of techniques and tip to make the painting beautiful.</p><br><br><br>
